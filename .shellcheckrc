# ShellCheck configuration for this repository.
# Keep this focused on correctness and low noise.

# Note: ShellCheck's minimum severity is enforced by callers (CI and local scripts)
# via `-S warning`, so this file can stay focused on repo-specific defaults.

# Most scripts in this repo are bash
shell=bash

# Avoid global disables; prefer narrow inline suppressions with justification.
